#Guideline for creating branch
create your branch in follwing format: yourprojectname/yourname/date

Task 1

Write the Java code of a program that prints the first ten positive whole numbers. [Do NOT use loops]

Task 2

Write the Java code of a program that prints the first ten even positive whole numbers. (Do NOT use loop or modulus operator for this problem).

Task 3

Write the Java code of a program that reads one number from the user, and prints it back to show which number was entered by the user.

Task 4

Write the Java code of a program that reads two numbers from the user, and prints their sum, product and difference.

Task 5

Write the Java code of a program that reads the radius of a circle and prints its circumference and area.

Task 6

Write the Java code of a program that reads two numbers from the user and prints “first” if the first number is greater than the second number.

Task 7

Write the Java code of a program that reads two numbers from the user. Your program should then print “first is greater” if the first number is greater, and “first is not greater” otherwise.

Task 8

Write the Java code of a program that reads two numbers from the user. Your program should then print “first is greater” if the first number is greater, “second is greater” if the second number is greater, and “the numbers are equal” otherwise.

Task 9

Write the Java code of a program that reads two numbers, subtracts the smaller number from the larger one, and prints the result.

Task 10

Write the Java code of a program that reads a number, and prints “The number is even” or “The number is odd”, depending on whether the number is even or odd. (Hint: use the modulus operator)
